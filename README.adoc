= Package Docs

This repository hosts pkldoc documentation for Pkl packages.

It scans for new packages by polling for the latest GitHub releases from a set of GitHub repositories.

== How documentation is generated

This repository scans for new releases of packages from a set of repositories, determined in link:build.gradle.kts[].

It works by listing releases of each of these repositories, and spawnings the pkldoc generator with the latest set of each package.

The documentation gets pushed to the `www` branch of this repository.
Once the documentation is pushed, the CI build for pkl-lang.org is triggered, which clones down the `www` branch and adds its contents to the resulting website.
